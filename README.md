[![Run Tests](https://github.com/luandadantas/jus-crawler-challenge/actions/workflows/run_tests.yaml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/luandadantas/jus-crawler-challenge/actions/workflows/run_tests.yaml)

Web Crawler that crawls/scrapes machine information at [Vultr](https://www.vultr.com/products/bare-metal/#pricing) and [Hostgator](https://www.hostgator.com/vps-hosting).

This project is the result of a technical challenge described in [this document](challenge_description.md).


## Pre-configuration

Ensure you have [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) installed on your machine. If you can run the following command without problems, it means that your machine already has python installed and will show you the python version it is using.

```bash
python3 --version
```

Python 3.10 was used for development, and it is recommended that you use this version or a newer one.

ItÂ´s also recommended to have a specific virtualenv for this project. You can create your virtual environment using the tool of your choice or create one by running:

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
```

```bash
source .venv/bin/activate # macos or linux
```
